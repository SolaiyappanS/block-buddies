# Block Buddies - Gameplay Guide

## Objective
Guide all players from their starting positions to the exit door in each of the 5 levels. Work together to solve puzzles using rocks and avoiding hazards.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** - Move your character
- **Mouse** - Click buttons in menus and alerts

## Game Mechanics

### Movement
- Use arrow keys (↑↓←→) or WASD to navigate the grid
- You cannot move through other players
- You cannot move through obstacles (river, lava, wind) - this restarts the level

### Rocks
- **Pushable objects** that help you navigate
- Approach a rock and press a direction to **push it**
- The rock moves in that direction (you can't push it off the grid)
- Rocks cannot be pushed into other rocks or the exit

### Obstacles
- **River** (blue water icon) - Impassable water
- **Lava** (red fire icon) - Burning hazard
- **Wind** (gray wind icon) - Blocked passage

### Rock-Obstacle Interaction
When you push a rock **onto** an obstacle:
1. The rock covers the obstacle (it becomes invisible)
2. The rock now occupies that space
3. The hazard is temporarily neutralized
4. When you move the rock away, the obstacle reappears

**Strategy**: Use rocks to cover hazards and create safe paths!

### Exit Door
- **Yellow door icon** at the end of each level
- **ALL players must reach it simultaneously**
- Once all players are at the exit, you advance to the next level

All player positions reset accordingly.

## Tips & Tricks

### Working as a Team
- Communicate with other players
